title: "Idea: Mobile Posting With Dropbox"  
date: 2011-01-20 23:40:00

I wanted to post a new idea when I was walking to the metro, but didn't have any way to do that. It'd be great to have a mobile posting interface, but I'd hate to have to wire up a web form to create a new post, add it to the repo, and then rebuild the site.

It'd be great if I could use [Elements][ele] to create a new post in [Dropbox][dro] and have a process looking for new posts via the [API][api] which would do all the heavy lifting.
