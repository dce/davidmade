title: "Is Francesca&rsquo;s Open?"  
date: 2011-10-23

Despite its popularity among Duke undergrads, Francesca's has become my go-to coffeeshop here in Durham due to its late hours and reliable wifi. Only problem is that its [website][web] doesn't include hours of operation or, really, any useful information at all. I got tired of calling them to find out how late they'd be open and decided to put up a website for that exclusive purpose, and thus: [Is Francesca&rsquo;s Open?][ifo]

Whole thing took about five hours start-to-finish, and it was fun to dust off the old PHP skills. Font is [Arvo][avr] from [FontSquirrel][fnt], and the code is available on [GitHub][gth].
