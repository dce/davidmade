Another [golden nugget][gbk] from [Cryptonomicon][cry]:

  > MEN WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE ACCOMPLISHING *SOMETHING*
  > by speaking speak in a different way from men who believe that
  > speaking is a *waste of time*. Bobby Shaftoe has learned most of
  > his practical knowledge -- how to fix a car. butcher a deer, throw a spiral,
  > talk to a lady, kill a Nip -- from the latter type of man. For them, trying to
  > do anything by talking is like trying to pound in a nail with a screwdriver.
  > Sometimes you can even see the desperation spread over such a man's
  > face as he listens to himself speak.

  > Men of the other type -- the ones who use speech as a tool of their
  > work, who are confident and fluent -- aren't necessarily more intelligent,
  > or even more educated. It took Shaftoe a long time to figure that out.

I couldn't stop thinking of this passage as I spent yesterday in an all-day planning meeting.
