  > The crux here, the issue driving this whole "Tebow Thing," is the matter of

  > Your rightness might be emotionally unsatisfying, but it confirms a stable
  > understanding of the universe. Sports fans who love statistics fall into
  > this camp. People who reject cognitive dissonance build this camp and find
  > the firewood. But Tebow wrecks all that, because he makes blind faith a
  > viable option. His faith in God, his followers' faith in him -- it all
  > defies modernity. This is why people care so much. He is making people
  > wonder if they should try to believe things they don't actually believe.
