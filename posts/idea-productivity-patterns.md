title: "Idea: Productivity Patterns"  
date: 2011-01-18

A simple app that lets you record information about work sessions, including: 

  * project
  * location
  * time of day
  * caffeine level
  * sleep level
  * overall outcome
  
The goal being to help identify patterns about what makes you maximally productive and secondarily to serve as a sort of what-I-did log.
