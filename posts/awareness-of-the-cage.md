title: "Awareness of the Cage"  
type: quote  
date: 2011-08-01

This is my favorite passage from *[Infinite Jest][inf]*. It's an exchange between
LaMont Chu, one of the players at the Enfield Tennis Academy, and Lyle, a man
who sits in the workout room and offers wisdom in exchange for licking sweat off
of the perspiring students. Sounds weird, I guess, but it doesn't really even
register among everything else going on in this book. Emphasis mine.

  > Lyle has a way of sucking on the insides of his cheeks as he listens. Plates
  > of old ridged muscle emerge and subside as he shifts his weight slightly on
  > the raised towel dispenser. The dispenser's at about shoulder-height for
  > someone like Chu. Like all good listeners, he has a way of attending that is
  > at once intense and assuasive: the supplicant feels both nakedly revealed
  > and sheltered, somehow, from all possible judgment. It's like he's working
  > as hard as you. You both of you, briefly, feel unalone. Lyle will suck in
  > first one side's cheek and then the other. 'You burn to have your photograph
  > in a magazine.' 'I'm afraid so.' 'Why again exactly, now?' 'I guess to be
  > felt about as I feel about those players with their pictures in magazines.'
  > 'Why?' 'Why? I guess to give my life some sort of kind of meaning, Lyle.'
  > 'And how would this do this again?' 'Lyle, I don't know. I do not know. It
  > just does. Would. Why else would I burn like this, clip secret pictures, not
  > take risks, not sleep or pee?' 'You feel these men with their photographs in
  > magazines care deeply about having their photographs in magazines. Derive
  > immense meaning.' 'I do. They must. I would. Else why would I burn like this
  > to feel as they feel?' 'The meaning they feel, you mean. From the fame.'
  > 'Lyle, don't they?' Lyle sucks his cheeks. It's not like he's condescending
  > or stringing you along. He's thinking as hard as you. It's like he's you in
  > the top of a clean pond. It's part of the attention. One side of his cheeks
  > almost caves in, thinking. 'LaMont, perhaps they did at first. The first
  > photograph, the first magazine, the gratified surge, the seeing themselves
  > as others see them, the hagiography of image, perhaps. Perhaps the first
  > time: *enjoyment*. **After that, do you trust me, trust me: they do not feel
  > what you burn for.** After the first surge, they care only that their
  > photographs seem awkward or unflattering, or untrue, or that their privacy,
  > this thing you burn to escape, what they call their privacy is being
  > violated. Something changes. After the first photograph has been in a
  > magazine, the famous men do not *enjoy* their photographs in magazines so
  > much as they fear that their photographs will cease to appear in magazines.
  > They are trapped, just as you are.' 'ls this supposed to be good news'? This
  > is awful news.' 'LaMont, are you willing to listen to a Remark about what is
  > true?' 'Okeydokey.' '**The truth will set you free. But not until it is
  > finished with you.**' 'Maybe I ought to be getting back.' 'LaMont, the world
  > is very old. You have been snared by something untrue. You are deluded. But
  > this is good news. You have been snared by the delusion that envy has a
  > reciprocal. You assume that there is a flip-side to your painful envy of
  > Michael Chang: namely Michael Chang's enjoyable feeling of
  > being-envied-by-LaMont-Chu. No such animal.' 'Animal?' 'You burn with hunger
  > for food that does not exist.' 'This is good news?' 'It is the truth. To be
  > envied, admired, is not it feeling. Nor is fame it feeling. There are
  > feelings associated with fame, but few of them are any more enjoyable than
  > the feelings associated with envy of fame.' 'The burning doesn't go away?'
  > '**What fire dies when you feed it?** It is not fame itself they wish to deny
  > you here. Trust them. There is much fear in fame. Terrible and heavy fear to
  > be pulled and held, carried. Perhaps they want only to keep it off you until
  > you weigh enough to pull it toward yourself.' 'Would I sound ungrateful if I
  > said this doesn't make me feel very much better at all?' 'La-Mont, the truth
  > is that the world is incredibly, incredibly, unbelievably old. You suffer
  > with the stunted desire caused by one of its oldest lies. Do not believe the
  > photographs. Fame is not the exit from any cage.' 'So I'm stuck in the cage
  > from either side. Fame or tortured envy of fame. There's no way out.' '**You
  > might consider how escape from a cage must surely require, foremost,
  > awareness of the fact of the cage.** And I believe I see a drop on your
  > temple, right... there. ...' Etc.

That's an actual [single paragraph][quo] in the book. Whether or not you enjoy
this passage says a lot about whether or not you'd enjoy the book as a whole.
