title: "Idea: Combinators in Ruby Talk"
date: 2011-01-17

I want to speak at the [Ruby on Ales][roa] conference in late March. I want to finish [To Mock a Mockingbird][mck]. I will propose a talk about applying the concepts in the book in Ruby, using code samples and real-world use cases.

[This post][rag] by Reg Braithwaite seems like a good place to start, but it's over my head at this point.
