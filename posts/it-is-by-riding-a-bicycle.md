  > It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best,
  > since you have to sweat up the hills and can coast down them.... Thus you
  > remember them as they actually are, while in a motorcar only a high hill
  > impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of country you
  > have driven through as you gain by riding a bicycle.
