title: "Orph"  
date: 2011-10-04

A few weeks back, I noticed several paragraphs on this site ending with single-word lines, known in typographic circles as "orphans". I took it upon myself to see these orphans removed, a problem which turned out to be much trickier than simply replacing the last space with a non-breaking space.
