title: "Orph"  
date: 2011-10-24

A few weeks back, I noticed several paragraphs on this site ending with single-word lines, known as *[orphans][wik]* in typographic circles. I took it upon myself to see these orphans removed, a problem which turned out to be much trickier than simply making the last space non-breaking. I got it nailed down, and the result is [Orph][ghb], available as a Ruby gem. Check it out if you're as selectively anal as I am.
