I got the chance to stop in at [Need Supply Co.][nsc] while visiting Richmond last weekend, and I really liked these [Hill-Side Pocket Squares][hsp], though hell if I was going to pay $45 for a what amounts to a piece of fabric.

Instead, I stopped by a local fabric store and bought a few kinds of linen cloth, which I took to a tailor and asked to have cut up into 13" squares with the edges sewn up. I picked them up today, and I'm really pleased with the results.
