To follow up on [last week's post][ltt], I spent some time today with some free [online typing tutorials][tut]. I worked on lesson #1, which focuses on only the `f` and `j` keys. Here are my results:

  [ltt]: http://davidmade.com/posts/learning-to-type.html
  [tut]: http://www.sense-lang.org/typing/tutor/index.php?lang=EN

    Rounds: 5
    WPM: 56.0
    Time: 65.0 seconds
    Correct: 302.0
    Incorrect: 13.0
    Accuracy: 0.9587

I'm feeling good about this -- those numbers are right in line with how I see myself as a typist and there's a clear path to improvement. STAY TUNED.
