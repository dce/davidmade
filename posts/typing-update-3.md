title: "Typing Update #3"

More typing practice today. Here are the results:

    Rounds: 25
    WPM: 62.72
    Time: 57.8 seconds
    Correct: 302.2
    Incorrect: 3.28
    Accuracy: 0.9893

Numbers up across the board, which is promising. I'd like to get the mistakes down before moving on to more than just the `f` and `j` keys.
