title: "Idea: Sync Torrents with Dropbox"  
date: 2011-01-22

Often when I'm at work, I'll think about something I'd like to download from Bittorrent, but when I'm home, I never wind up doing it. [Transmission][trn], my torrent client of choice, has the option to watch a folder for new files and automatically begin downloading them. I could install [Dropbox][drp] on a media server under my TV and then put torrent files into a designated folder that the server would automatically pick up and begin downloading.
