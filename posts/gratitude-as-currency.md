title: "Gratitude as Currency"  
date: 2012-06-11

A funny thing happened a week or so ago that I'm still trying to wrap my head around. Some people I know from the local web community launched a new site that was heavily inspired by something I'd done at the end of last year. Same format, same design elements, although the entire thing was recoded from scratch. The goal of both sites is to make life slightly more convenient for Durham residents. Sounds great, right? The only thing that's bothering me is that they made no mention of my work, not on their site, nor their tweets announcing the site, nor on the GitHub page.

I'm not particularly upset. I don't feel like I've been the victim of theft or anything like that. I'm just confused. It seems so obvious to me that you'd link to the site that inspired you. For those of us who make free things for the web, gratitude is the only currency we have. And unlike other forms of currency which, when you spend it, you have less of, when you give gratitude, you wind up with more than when you started. A tweet mentioning my work would have earned a retweet to all of my followers and a congratulatory reply. Share the love, is all I'm saying. Otherwise, what's the point?
