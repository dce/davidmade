I've had this one in my head for a few days, and I spent a good hour and half playing around with it tonight. I easily could have spent twice as long on it, but once the audio started distorting in my head, I knew it was time to call it a wrap and go to bed.

The chord progression is Bmb5-Bb-F, which is a trick I might've stolen from the Beatles or might have just made up. I probably just made it up.
