title: "Typing Update #2"  
date: 2011-04-23

I sat down for some more typing practice this afteroon, knocking out 40 rounds of the [exercise][exr] I linked to earlier this week. Today's results:

    Rounds: 40
    WPM: 58.6
    Time: 61.45 seconds
    Correct: 301.925
    Incorrect: 4.375
    Accuracy: 0.9857

I had two mistake-free rounds. I found that focusing on accuracy rather than speed led to overall faster times, which makes sense since mistakes really screw up the typing flow.

If you're interested in doing something like this, I've been storing my results in vaguely Markdown-ish [data files][dat] which I then process with a simple [Ruby script][gst].
