title: "Typing Update #2"  
date: 2011-04-23

I sat down for some more typing practice this afteroon, knocking out 40 rounds of the [exercise][exr] I linked to earlier this week. I'll spare you the full dataset (though [it's available][dat]) and instead provide a summary I created with a [simple script][gst]. Wednesday's results:

  [exr]: http://www.sense-lang.org/typing/tutor/index.php?lang=EN 
  [dat]: /data/ex-1-2011-04-23.txt
  [gst]: https://gist.github.com/1a1926e7d41655889d8d

    Rounds: 5
    WPM: 56.0
    Time: 65.0 seconds
    Correct: 302.0
    Incorrect: 13.0
    Accuracy: 0.9587

Today's results:

    Rounds: 40
    WPM: 58.6
    Time: 61.45 seconds
    Correct: 301.925
    Incorrect: 4.375
    Accuracy: 0.9857

I had two mistake-free rounds. I found that focusing on accuracy rather than speed led to overall faster times, which makes sense since mistakes really screw up the typing flow.
