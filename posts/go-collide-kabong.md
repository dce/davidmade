title: "Go: Collide: Kabong"  
type: quote  
date: 2011-08-06

While it's on my mind, this is my second favorite bit from [Infinite Jest][inf]:

  [inf]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest

  > 'This myth of the competition and bestness we fight for you players here:
  > this myth: they assume here always the efficient way is to plow in straight,
  > go! The story that the shortest way between two places is the straight line,
  > yes?'

  > 'Yes?'

  > Schtitt can use the stem of the pipe to point, for emphasis: 'But what then
  > when something is in the way when you go between places, no? **Plow ahead:
  > go: collide: _kabong._**'

Not as insightful as the [previous quote][cag], but remarkable use of
onomatopoeia. Full text available on [Google Books][gbk].
