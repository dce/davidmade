Good exchange between a fictionalized version of [Christiaan Huygens][huy] and one of the main characters from *[Quicksilver][qik]*:

  > "It is all right for a clock to run fast or slow at times, so long as it
  > is calibrated against the sun, and set right. The sun may come out only
  > once in a fortnight. It is enough. A few minutes' light around noon is
  > all that you need to discover the error, and re-set the clock -- provided
  > that you bother to go up and make the observation. My parents somehow
  > knew this, and did not become overly concerned at my strange enthusiasms.
  > For they had confidence that they had taught me how to know when I was
  > running awry, and to calibrate my behavior."

  > "Now I think I understand," Eliza said. "It remains only to apply this
  > principle to me, I suppose."

  > "If I come down in the morning to find you copulating on my table with a
  > foreign deserter, as if you were some sort of Vagabond," Huygens said, "I
  > am annoyed. I admit it. **But that is not as important as what you do
  > next.** If you posture defiantly, it tells me that you have not learned
  > the skill of recognizing when you are running awry, and correcting
  > yourself. And you must leave my house in that case, for such people only
  > go further and further astray until they find destruction. **But if you
  > take this opportunity to consider where you have gone wrong, and to
  > adjust your course, it tells me that you shall do well enough in the
  > end.**"
