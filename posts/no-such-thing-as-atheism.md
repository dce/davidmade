More [DFW][dfw], this time from a [commencement speech][ken] he gave at Kenyon College:

  > Because here's something else that's true. In the day-to-day trenches of
  > adult life, there is no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not
  > worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.
  > And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type
  > thing to worship -- be it JC or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan
  > mother-goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of ethical
  > principles -- is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you
  > alive. If you worship money and things -- if they are where you tap real
  > meaning in life -- then you will never have enough. Never feel you have
  > enough. It's the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure
  > and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will
  > die a million deaths before they finally plant you. On one level, we all
  > know this stuff already -- it's been codified as myths, proverbs, clich&eacute;s,
  > bromides, epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick
  > is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness. Worship power -- you
  > will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to
  > keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart -- you will
  > end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.
