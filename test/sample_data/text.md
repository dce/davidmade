I've been working on a little app called **DOIT** to manage my daily goals from the command line. Here's my list from yesterday:

    > doit yesterday

    _ create
    X exercise
    X meditate
    X practice
    X read

It's all written in [CoffeeScript][cfs], one of my favorite little languages. Check it out [on GitHub][ghb].
